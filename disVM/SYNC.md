# Current synchronization / Текущая синхронизация — v0.1593

Selected experiment: `74c193724a7352b8fda2724a5cf10029885be68c`.
Includes unique array-view SLICEA leaves and self-load ownership from 4d9ce2e,
plus our returned Loader construction/scalar result-slot fix.
[Module audit](libraries/MODULE_AUDIT.md) · [Upstream Loader contract](upstream/libinterp/tests/README.loader-results.md).
Vendored files remain byte-identical; native ARM64/RISC-V platform execution
is not established by host/emulator fixtures. Earlier reports follow as history.

# Dis, JIT and Sys refresh — v0.1540

[Полный русский отчёт](SYNC.ru.md) · [Manifest](UPSTREAM.json)

Source: https://github.com/bhgv/Inferno-OS-bhgv, **experiment**.
Pinned commit: `f948343b711c8300dbf76417254c18a7a8d2f5ff`, eight commits after
previous Dis snapshot `24892373ee09a2a23dc39b9dedc01fb7af61d8c1`.

## Imported and adapted

AMD64/ARM64 real arithmetic, powers/conversions/rounding, signed fixed scales
and minus-one division; emu/os Sys FD ownership/publication and unaligned
connection/result slots; process/heap diagnostics. The native Limbo bootstrap
also retains divisor evaluation and division-by-zero traps when fixed scaling
would otherwise lower to a constant zero.

The selected snapshots contain 192 Dis/reference-test files and 174 temporary
bootstrap files. Original blobs, notices and SHA-256 hashes are retained.
The new devprog bodies and two compiler source files support extracted
regressions only. No whole Inferno, GUI, Math or Geometry module was imported.
The project's Coco/R compiler remains the priority.

CMake stays compatible with 3.10; the Dis component version is now 0.1.4.
Eleven new production regressions and eight foreign-emitter build checks are
registered. TLS register/safepoint generation and the FlashVM owner bridge retain
their ABI. The Sys module header is unchanged; its implementation was refreshed.

## Executed validation, Linux AMD64

- Core build and regressions: 42/42.
- TLS/FlashVM bridge/GC tests plus foreign-emitter checks: 62/62.
- Eight focused Sys/diagnostic drivers with UBSan: 8/8.
- Source-built Limbo bootstrap product test: 1/1.
- Six IDE service modules and their .sbl files rebuilt with that bootstrap.
- Both provenance manifests verified.

Native AMD64 execution, WORD-width fixtures and ARM64/RV64 emitter construction
are distinct evidence. No ARM64/RV64 execution or Windows/macOS/Android runtime
acceptance is claimed. Sys tests inject OS/scheduler boundaries around actual
production bodies. The complete executable Dis host, Sys/VFS registration and
IDE startup remain unfinished. No newly confirmed upstream defect was found.
